### AdventureWorks Sales Data Analysis (Advanced-SQL-and-Databases)

In this project, I tackled various business questions using the AdventureWorks 2005 database, accessed via BigQuery. The goal was to create detailed SQL queries to extract, transform, and analyze data relevant to the company's operations and sales performance.

#### Tasks Included:

**Customer Insights**: Generated comprehensive customer profiles, including identity, contact, location, and sales data, to provide actionable insights into individual customers.
**Customer Segmentation**: Identified top customers who had not placed orders in the last 365 days, enabling targeted marketing efforts.
**Activity Status**: Enhanced customer data with activity status, distinguishing between active and inactive customers over the past year.
**Regional Sales Reporting**: Analyzed monthly sales numbers across countries and regions, enriched with cumulative totals, sales rankings, and tax rate calculations to provide a holistic view of sales performance.

*This exercise not only reinforced my SQL skills but also demonstrated my ability to translate complex business requirements into precise and efficient queries, ultimately driving data-driven decision-making.*
